In a related tutorial about how to optimize image alt tags for SEO, I briefly went over the importance of naming your image files in a way that makes them easier to rank in search engine’s image search.

This article is only about how to name your files (images or not).

How to name your image files
This is what Google says about how to name image files:

The filename can give Google clues about the subject matter of the image. For example, my-new-black-kitten.jpg is better than IMG00023.JPG.

With that in mind, here’s a simple recipe for making SEO-friendly image filenames that makes search engines like Google happy. The following will apply to any file you embed on your website, images, PDFs, etc.:

Make your filenames short but descriptive.
Add your focus keyword at the beginning of the file name.
If your file is an image, its file name should reflect the alt tag description — but without filler words like “on“, “in”, “to”, etc.
Note: focus keyword means the most important keyword that describes your image or file the best for people who typically search for that type of content.
